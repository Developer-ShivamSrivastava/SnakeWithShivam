# SnakeWithShivam

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food. This project involves creating a Snake Game using the Python programming language and the Pygame module, which provides a set of tools and functions for game development.

The game will have a graphical interface where the player can navigate the snake using arrow keys. The snake moves continuously in a grid-like area, and the player's objective is to eat the food without colliding with the boundaries of the play area or with its own body.

The game will feature a scoring system to keep track of the player's progress, with each food item eaten adding to the score. Additionally, the game will have sound effects to enhance the gaming experience.

By building the Snake Game using Python and Pygame, I can learn fundamental game development concepts such as game loops, collision detection, and sprite handling. It's a fun project that allows for customization and creativity, making it an excellent learning experience for beginners and intermediate programmers alike.
