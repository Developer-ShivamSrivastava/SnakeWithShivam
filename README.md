# SnakeWithShivam

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food. This project involves creating a Snake Game using the Python programming language and the Pygame module, which provides a set of tools and functions for game development.

The game will have a graphical interface where the player can navigate the snake using arrow keys. The snake moves continuously in a grid-like area, and the player's objective is to eat the food without colliding with the boundaries of the play area or with its own body.

The game will feature a scoring system to keep track of the player's progress, with each food item eaten adding to the score. Additionally, the game will have sound effects to enhance the gaming experience.

By building the Snake Game using Python and Pygame, I can learn fundamental game development concepts such as game loops, collision detection, and sprite handling. It's a fun project that allows for customization and creativity, making it an excellent learning experience for beginners and intermediate programmers alike.

# How to play?
1. Download & Install python interpeter from https://www.python.org/
2. After download Python, to check python is install or not -> ```python --version``` if your python your python version will show that means you have successfully install Python. Otherwise, any you have made a mistake during python installation. Try to reinstall python.
3. Open cmd/terminal then write this command carefully -->  ```pip install pygame```. If this execute successfully, move forward towards next step.
4. Final step, Open terminal in that folder where you download this repo and then type ```python snake.py``` and press enter.
5. And, play & enjoy the game and make a high score.

Note:- Do not delete any file or folder because all files & folders are important.
